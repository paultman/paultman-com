This is the personal blog of Paul Maneesilasan. It is based on the [Astro](https://astro.build) SSG framework, leveraging [AstroPaper](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper), thanks to [Sat Naing](https://satnaing.dev).

Although tags were supported, I also added support for categories.  
I did that by adding a categries folder in src/pages, along with an index.astro and dynatmic [category].astro pages.

I also added that field to front matter of posts, updated the ts post definition, and pulled unique categories from the posts collection. See the commit diff above for details.
