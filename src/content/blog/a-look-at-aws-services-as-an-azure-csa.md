## Background

Since starting work with Microsoft last year (2022), I have completely moved off using AWS and GCP, to exclusively using Azure. Now that I know Azure services well, I thought I'd go back and look at how they line up with their AWS counterparts.

Since there are so many, I'll split this into categories and only focus on the most popular services in each area.

This is meant to be a high level look at AWS Services. I will follow up with future posts where I will walk though: setting up a 3-tier architecture, how to configure CI/CD in AWS, and look at monitoring, reporting, and cost analysis. Those subsequent posts will use many of the service I'm outlining here, I'll start with an overview.
