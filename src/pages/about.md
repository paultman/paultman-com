<p>I was born in the Baltimore, Maryland (Go Ravins!) and grew up in the DC area (Go Wizards!). At the University of Maryland, College Park (Go Terps!), I studied finance, and my after my third semester added Computer Science.</p>

<p>Since then I’ve worked for both small and large companies, all over the world. In all that time, and though all those experiences, I’ve keep a journal and I continue to update it. Now though, rather than only writing for one, I’ll write for many, sharing insights, <s>mistakes</s> lessons learned, and my ever changing viewpoints.</p>

<p>I hope this brief window into my thoughts provides you with yet another datapoint in your quest to do the same, to learn, and to grow.</p>
